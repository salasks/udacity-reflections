	> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may have some files in your local working directory that you are currently working on, and 
	don't want your current changes to these files to be overwritten by changes to the remote branch.

	> Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

    Branches allow you to develop complex features independent from the primary master branch.
    In this way, you can commit non-production ready code without breaking anything.
    Branches can be local or shared.
    A clone is a copy of code, usually between different systems or different users.
    A fork is a GitHub-specific term when you want to copy someone else's code for development
    purposes and still link back to their version.
